	@description = It is well known that the tasty sugary goodness found inside plant sap contains life-giving oxidizer, but new processes developed by scientists have allowed for a much more concentrated form of the oxidizer, and therefore a rather explosive volatile material. This tube is filled with the stuff, so good luck. The thrust of these motors is ridiculous for their size, and they're burned through very quickly.

	@description = After one Jebediah K. contacted the Maltibore Gun Club with an offer they couldn't refuse, they at once began work on a massive black powder rocket motor. Though it has been criticized by many respectable scientists as "a little overboard, don't you think?" it remains the go-to option for getting big things going, or small things going fast.
