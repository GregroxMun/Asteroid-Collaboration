	@description = We needed a way of actually getting the air out of the air cans, and this specialized thruster unit does just that. Granted, it's little more than an air valve connected to a nozzle, but our engineers insist that it's a rocket engine nevertheless.

	@title = CGRCS-1 Cold Gas RCS Thruster
	@manufacturer = Aethereal Developments Inc
	@description = After a scientist was tragically lost to escape velocity while testing a new "fire extinguisher," his mourning colleagues formulated a method of harnessing this uncontrolled thrust in a controlled way, and thus the CGRCS-1 thruster was born. Aerocan propellant tanks sold separately.
