	@description = After the a bad run in with a new state of matter called "fire," the scientists at Aethereal Developments needed to develop a way of controlling the spread of the hot mess. They tried several different kinds of air in several different combinations, before discovering one that didn't make the problem worse. It was promptly packed up into a cylindrified can to be deployed whenever needed.
